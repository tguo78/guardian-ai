    <p>Invisible protection against cyberbullying — ethical, local and real-time.</p>
  </header>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Cyberbullying has evolved with our digital lives. It's not always public or visible — often it hides in private messages, subtle exclusions, or repeated microaggressions that slowly isolate and damage. While early internet days saw around 19% of teens affected, today, over half experience cyberbullying, with some studies showing over 60% depending on gender.</p>
    <p>The hardest part? Perception. What one person sees as a joke, another experiences as trauma. Exclusion, impersonation, hateful messaging — the forms vary, but the psychological toll is real. And traditional solutions like education, moderation, or reporting are often too slow, too late, or too easy to bypass.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
    <p>GuardianAI is a new kind of safety net: a silent, respectful layer of protection directly on the device. Built with on-device AI, GuardianAI analyzes messages in real time — without sending any data to the cloud, ensuring complete privacy.</p>
    <p>It doesn’t watch, it doesn’t judge — it listens. When it detects a message with clear signs of potential harm, it can suggest reflection, block the message, or gently notify a trusted adult if pre-approved. All decisions stay on the device, invisible to others.</p>
    <p>GuardianAI aims to act at the critical moment — before harm occurs. It’s not punishment. It’s digital empathy, embedded at the right place, at the right time.</p>
